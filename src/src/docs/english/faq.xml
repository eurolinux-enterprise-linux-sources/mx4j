      <question>
         <para>
            How it is possible to change the default log level
            of the MX4J implementation to understand what is going on ?
         </para>
      </question>
      <answer>
         <para>
            Just set the system property 'mx4j.log.priority' to one of these values (from less verbose to more verbose):
            <itemizedlist>
               <listitem>fatal</listitem>
               <listitem>error</listitem>
               <listitem>warn</listitem>
               <listitem>info</listitem>
               <listitem>debug</listitem>
               <listitem>trace</listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            like this example command line:
         </para>
         <para>
            > java -Dmx4j.log.priority=debug -classpath . my.package.Application
         </para>
         <para>
            See the MX4J documentation about logging for more information.

      <question>
         <para>
            The MLet file format is not enough flexible for my needs.
            Is there a more powerful configuration file format, maybe in XML, by means of which
            will be possible to load and configure the MBeans of a system ?
         </para>
      </question>
      <answer>
         <para>
            MX4J, from version 2.0, supports a configuration file format in XML, by which it is
            possible to specify constructor arguments to MBeans, call methods on object and MBeans,
            register and unregister MBeans and so on.
            <sbr/>
            Think of this configuration file format as an XML way to invoke Java methods and JMX
            attributes or operations.
         </para>
         <para>
            The class that allows this is <classname>mx4j.tools.config.ConfigurationLoader</classname>.
            Refer to the MX4J tools documentation for details about usage of this class.
         </para>
